Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

To do this, I am using a model where each student is represented by a green dot (passed) or a red dot (failed). Then drawing a decision line separating that two groups. What is important, this line is drawn in such way, where it is as far as possible from individual students - we call it maximizing margin. Why is this important? Because it allows us to make better predictions whether new students will pass or fail. If it would be not the case, the model could be more likely to predict passed (or failed) without any real reasons. In the picture (A) we can see three lines. All of them separates data correctly. But they would not give the same answer for a new student (blue dot). The top line will prefer classifying as failed, the bottom as passed. A line in the middle is as far as possible from all of the students - this provides no preference when predicting.\n",
